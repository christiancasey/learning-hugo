<span style="color:black;"> When attempting to understand and use Hugo, the most difficult part was getting my computer to understand Hugo as a command. Ultimately, I decided to use my dad's computer so I could learn Hugo before Thursday, and it worked much better.</span>

### **I managed to do a couple things**

<span style="color:black;">

1. Install a lot of stuff  
  * Chocolatey 2x
  * Hugo 2x
  * Atom and Git on my dad's computer
  * Hugo themes
2. Create a Hugo site
3. Create these posts

I have to say... good job me :)
