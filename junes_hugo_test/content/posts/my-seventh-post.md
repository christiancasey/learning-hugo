### **Her Story**
###### <span style="color:grey">Margaret Sanger popularized the term "birth control" and was one of the first people in the U.S. to distribute information about contraception. She was prosecuted due to her book on her ideas and fled to the U.K. until she felt safe. She opened the first birth control clinic in the U.S. and was arrested for giving an undercover agent a family planning pamphlet. Her trial was controversial, and she argued that in order for women to lead healthy lives, they needed to be able to control when they had children. She founded the American Birth Control League in 1921, which became Planned Parenthood. It's important to note she believed abortions should be avoided, and her ideas are separate from Planned Parenthood's current goals. </span>
